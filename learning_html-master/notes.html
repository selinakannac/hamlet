<h1> A bit about the internet</h1>

<h2> URL</h2>

<h3>URL stands for *Uniform Resource Locator*. It contains serveral different parts, including:</h3>

.<li> the **protocol**: e.g. http, https, ftp</li>
.<li> the **host**: e.g. www.facebook.com, www.bbc.co.uk</li>
.<li> the **path**: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95</li>

<h2> DNS</h2>
<strong>DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.</strong>

<h2> Server-side vs. Client-side technologies</h2>

<h3> Client-side</h3>

<strong>Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are</strong>

<li>1. HTML</li>
<li>2. CSS</li>
<li>3. Javascript</li>

<h2> Server-side</h2>

<strong>Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.</strong>
